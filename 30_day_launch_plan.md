# 30-Day Launch Plan: ParentingCertainty

**Goal:** Acquire 100 Active Users.
**Strategy:** "The Vulnerable Builder" (Value-First, Low-Promotion).

---

##  Week 1: The "Soft Launch" (Reddit)
*Focus: Getting your first 10 users and feedback.*

*   **Day 1 (Tuesday/Wednesday best):**
    *   **Action:** Post the "Vulnerable Parent" story (from `marketing_strategy.md`) to **r/Parenting**.
    *   **Rule:** Do NOT put the link in the main post body if the subreddit rules are strict. Put it in the *comments* or say "Link in bio/DM me".
    *   **Engagement:** Reply to EVERY comment within 1 hour. Verified builders get 10x trust.

*   **Day 2:**
    *   **Action:** Monitor specific keywords on Reddit using [f5bot.com](https://f5bot.com) (It's free).
    *   **Keywords (Copy Paste these):**
        *   **Direct Pain:** "yelled at my son", "yelled at my daughter", "lost my temper", "screaming at kids", "scared my child", "anger management parenting".
        *   **The Feeling:** "mom guilt yelling", "worst mom ever", "worst dad ever", "hate myself for yelling", "parenting burnout", "at my wits end".
        *   **The Trigger:** "overstimulated mom", "noise sensitivity", "toddler won't listen", "bedtime battle", "sensory overload parent".
        *   **Niche:** "ADHD rage", "autistic burnout parenting", "gentle parenting is hard".
    *   **Reply:** When someone posts about yelling, comment: *"I struggled with this too. I actually built a free tool to give me a script in that moment."* (Soft sell).

*   **Day 3:**
    *   **Action:** Post to **r/daddit**.
    *   **Angle:** "Fellow Dads, I built a tool to stop myself from yelling." (Dads love practical tools).

*   **Day 4-7:**
    *   **Action:** Fix critical bugs found by these first users.
    *   **Action:** DM every user who signed up (if you have emails via Lemon Squeezy) asking for 1 feedback item.

## Week 2: Content Repurposing (Short Video)
*Focus: Visualizing the "Regulation Station".*

*   **Day 8:**
    *   **Action:** Record a screen capture of the **"Coherent Breathing"** circle on your phone.
    *   **Post:** Post to **TikTok / Instagram Reels / YouTube Shorts**.
    *   **Caption:** "POV: You're about to lose it, but you press this button." (No talking needed, just the visual + Brown Noise audio).
    *   **Hashtags:** #gentleparenting #adhdparenting #overstimulation

*   **Day 10:**
    *   **Action:** Crosspost the video to **r/adhdwomen** or **r/ADHD** dealing with "Overstimulation". 
    *   **Title:** "I made a visual breathing tool for when I get overstimulated by my kids."

*   **Day 12:**
    *   **Action:** Create a "Crisis Script" carousel for Instagram/Pinterest.
    *   **Slide 1:** "Stop Yelling."
    *   **Slide 2:** "Say this instead:"
    *   **Slide 3:** *[Screenshot of your app's script]*
    *   **Slide 4:** "Link in bio to get the full script."

## 📅 Week 3: Niche Communities
*Focus: Targeting High-Pain Groups.*

*   **Day 15:**
    *   **Target:** **Neurodivergent Parents**.
    *   **Action:** Post in relevant Facebook Groups (search "Parents with ADHD").
    *   **Pitch:** "I built this because my ADHD brain can't remember gentle parenting scripts in the heat of the moment."

*   **Day 17:**
    *   **Action:** Find "Mommy Bloggers" or Micro-Influencers on Twitter/X with <5k followers.
    *   **Pitch:** DM them: "Hi [Name], I built a free tool to help parents stop yelling. No strings attached, just thought your audience might find it helpful. Here is the link." (If the product is good, they will share it for free).

## 📅 Week 4: Search & Stability
*Focus: passive traffic.*

*   **Day 22:**
    *   **Action:** Submit to **ProductHunt**.
    *   **Title:** "ParentingCertainty - The Panic Button for Parents."
    *   **Tagline:** "Instant scripts and nervous system regulation for when you're about to yell."

*   **Day 25:**
    *   **Action:** SEO. Write a blog post (or Medium article).
    *   **Title:** "How I Used Brown Noise to Stop Yelling at My Toddler."
    *   **Content:** Share your story, embed the Brown Noise audio player (or screenshots of your app).

*   **Day 30:**
    *   **Review:** Look at your Lemon Squeezy Dashboard.
    *   **Question:** Did people finish the 3-day trial and convert?
    *   **Adjustment:**
        *   If **Yes**: Scale (Buy $5/day Reddit Ads on r/Parenting).
        *   If **No**: Ask them why (Price too high? Feature didn't work?).
