# Marketing Strategy: Reddit (r/Parenting)

**Goal:** Secure your first 100 users by providing genuine value, avoiding "spam" bans, and leveraging the free trial "Hook".

## 1. The "Vulnerable Parent" Strategy
Reddit hates ads. Reddit loves stories.
You must position yourself not as a "CEO selling a product," but as a **Fellow Parent solving a personal pain.**

**Your Persona:**
*   You are transparent about your struggles (anger, overwhelm).
*   You are sharing a "hack" or a tool you made for yourself first.
*   The "App" is just the easiest way to share that tool.

## 2. The Draft Post (Copy/Edit This)

**Title Options:**
*   *Option A:* I built a simple tool to stop myself from yelling during meltdowns, and it's actually working.
*   *Option B:* I got tired of the "Post-Yelling Guilt," so I built a panic button for my phone.

**Body Text:**
"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that has helped me keep my cool lately. Like many here, I struggle with the 'Red Mist' when my toddler has a meltdown or hits me. My IQ basically drops to zero, and I default to yelling, which makes everything worse.

I learned about 'Cognitive Offloading'—the idea that in high-stress moments, you shouldn't try to think; you should just execute a plan. 

So I spent the last few weekends coding a simple web app called **ParentingCertainty**. 

**How it works:**
1.  **Red Button:** When things go south (hitting, screaming), I tap a big red button.
2.  **The Script:** It instantly gives me a script to read. *"I see you are angry. I will not let you hit me."*
3.  **The Voice:** It actually reads the script out loud in a calm voice. This breaks the tension and cues *me* to regulate my own nervous system.

It's been 14 days and I haven't lost my temper once. It turns out, just having a 'Script' in my pocket gives me the certainty to stay calm.

**I wanted to share it here:**

**Cost:**
I put a lot of work into the AI engine, so I plan to charge for it eventually to cover server costs. **But I made it completely free to use for the first 3 days (No credit card needed).** 

I just want other parents to try the method and tell me if it helps them as much as it helped me. 

Let me know what you think. And hang in there—it's a tough job."

## 3. The Follow-Up (Comments)
*   **Reply to everyone.**
*   **Be humble.** If they say "This is expensive," say: "I appreciate that feedback! I'm just trying to cover the AI costs, but I tried to make the free trial accessible to everyone."
*   **Ask for features.** "What situation do you struggle with most? I can add it to the script library."

## 4. Other Communities
Once you post on `r/Parenting`, wait 24 hours, then crosspost (adjusting the tone slightly) to:
*   `r/daddit` (Very supportive, loves "Dad builds tool" stories).
*   `r/toddlers` (The core target audience).
*   `r/Mommit`

## 🚀 Launch Checklist
1.  **Verify Lemon Squeezy:** Make sure your payment link works *before* the 3-day trial expires for these first users.
2.  **Mobile Friendly:** Check the app heavily on your phone. Redditors are 90% mobile.
3.  **Deploy:** Ensure the latest "3-Day Hook" version is live on Netlify.
